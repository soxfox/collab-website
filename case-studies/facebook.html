    <h1>Facebook Case Study</h1>
    <br>
    <q>This page is in relation to Facebook's official privacy policy. Although Facebook is one of the most trusted social media platforms to date, there is still a <strong>HUGE </strong>chance of your information being at risk of publicity. It's not that simple - there's a lot more to it that you think...</q>
    <br>
    <h2>Here's what Facebook is collecting from you:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Age</li>
      <li>Gender</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Networks</li>
      <li>Photos and videos</li>
      <li>Tags and facial data (for Tag Suggestions) </li>
      <li>Which profiles you look at</li>
      <li>Who you chat with through Facebook Messenger</li>
      <li>Relationship status</li>
      <li>"Likes" (anytime you click the "Like" button on Facebook or a third-party website)</li>
      <li>Lists of favourite things (movies, music, books, etc.)</li>
      <li>Political affiliation</li>
      <li>Which websites you visit and when</li>
      <li>Anything you purchase with Facebook Credits</li>
      <li>Browser type</li>
      <li>Operating system type</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>GPS location</li>
      <li>User ID number</li>
      <li>Username</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What does Facebook use your information for?</h2>
    <q><i>We use the information we receive about you <strong>in connection with</strong> the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use.</q></i> <strong>Facebook 2015</strong>
    <br>
    <p>"In connection with" could mean many things. Here, Facebook explains only a few examples. There could be many, many more.</p>
    <p>Facebook, however, does state that the company can see anything you do on their platform, or anything your friends link you to in relation to their services. Facebook also reserves the right to use your data, as long as it has either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>received your permission</li>
      <li>told you it would do so (through the Data Use Policy)</li>
      <li>or removed any personally identifiable information, such as your name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, Facebook can use your information in any way if you give them permission to, as long as that piece of information is "in connection with the services and features" it provides. As you can tell, "services and features" could mean anything.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Deactivating vs. deleting your Facebook account</h2>
    <p>Facebook allows you to hide your account in two ways: those being deactivation and deletion.</p>
    <p><strong>Deactivate:</strong> If you decide to deactivate your account, your name will still be able to show up on past friends’ "friends lists". This means that any of your information can still be used by Facebook or any third-party website, game, or application that can be accessed to any one of your friends’ contact lists. (Reactivation is possible.)</p>
    <p><strong>Delete:</strong> Unlike deactivation, deletion is permanent. Almost all of you data will be removed from Facebook within a 90 day time period. (Facebook doesn’t say why this process takes so long.) You still have to be careful though. If you delete your account, specific information — for example, all of your conversations with other Facebook users, or group posts — will stay on the website, as this does not associate with Facebooks’ other services.</p>
    
    <h2>Facebook sharing in a nutshell</h2>
    <p>Facebook allows you to have the choice on how (almost all of) your personal information is shared to the public. There is still one problem. Your friends also have the same ability — and some of their information includes stuff about you. </p>
    <p>Here’s an example: Although you can have your settings set to the tightest option of security, other people can still be able to see comments you leave on various updates, photos, links, or videos that they share themselves. The person who posted it can control who sees comments and all related updates.</p>
    <p>Here’s a second example: Even if you hide your own friends list, you can still appear on your friends’ friends lists - which may be publicly available or shared with third-party websites or apps.</p>
    <p>In short, <i>anything posted by you that is controllable by another person, is unable to be hidden.</i></p>
    
    <h2>Instant Personalization</h2>
    <p>Facebook has <strong>LOTS and LOTS</strong> of partnerships with a wide range of websites, like Rotten Tomatoes, to serve "instant personalization." Instant personalization means that, if you’re signed into Facebook, any one of Facebook’s partnered websites can use your "public information." This also includes your User ID and friends list. This gives you the choice to comment on any one of these sites, and look at how your Facebook friends have used the site.</p>
    <p><strong>The sites that Facebook have partnered with include:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Bing – Social Search</li>
      <li>Pandora – Personalized Music</li>
      <li>TripAdvisor – Social Travel</li>
      <li>Yelp – Friends’ Local Reviews</li>
      <li>Rotten Tomatoes – Friends’ Movie Reviews</li>
      <li>Clicker – Personalized TV Recommendations</li>
      <li>Scribd – Social Reading</li>
      <li>Docs – Document Collaboration</li>
      <li>Zynga – Social Games (The Ville, Zynga Slingo and 7 other games)</li>
      <li>Kixeye – Social Games (War Commander and Battle Pirates)</li>
      <li>EA – Social Games (SimCity Social)</li>
    </ul>
