    <h1>Case Study on European Privacy Law</h1>
    <h2>Under Construction!</h2>
    <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new law being introduced by the European Union Parliament for the whole of the European Union. It is claimed that this new law is the most important change  and biggest overhaul in privacy regulation in the last 20 years and take effect as of the 25th of May 2018. </p>
    <h3>What the GDPR means for business:</h3>
    <p>
      The GDPR will apply to all business in the EU who process personnel data of subjects residing in the EU, regardless of the location of the processing.  No the only way this law will apply to business outside of the EU is if the data is about "offering goods or services to EU citizens (irrespective of whether payment is required) and the monitoring of behaviour that takes place within the EU" then the law will apply to processors not located in the EU.”
      There are also strengthened conditions for consent with companies not being allowed to use long terms and conditions as consent. Instead consent forms will have to be in a separate form that is easily accessible.
    </p>
    <h3>Major Changes:</h3>
    <p>There are few major changes in the GPDR that will help to protect the consumer. </p>
    <h4>Breach Notification:</h4>
    <p>Under the GDPR, if a company has a data breach that is likely to “result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals,” they must notify data subjects and controllers within 72 hours of becoming aware of the data breach</p>
    <h4>Right to Access:</h4>
    <p>Under the new laws enforced by the GDPR, data subjects now have the right to obtain information on whether or not his/her personal data is being processed, where and what for. This has to be given to the data subject in an easily accessible electronic format, free of charge.</p>
    <h4>Right to be forgotten:</h4>
    <p>lso known as, data erasure, the right to be forgotten lets data subjects have controllers erase his/her personnel data and cease further distribution of the data. It can also potentially have third parties halt the processing of the data. </p>
    <h4>Privacy by Design:</h4>
    <p>this key change means that companies must include data protection from the onset of designing a system</p>
    <h4>Data Protection Officers:</h4>
    <p>This key changes means that companies will not have to submit notifications/ registrations to each local DPA. It will also not be required to notify/obtain approval for transfers based on the Model Contract Clauses (MCCs). </p>
    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      These are the key changes as listed on the official GDPR. They are being introduced to try to stop a repeat of the Facebook situation as well as protect the citizens located in the European Union. There have been court cases such as in the United States, with Microsoft, where Microsoft have refused to show data that has been processed overseas. The GDPR aims to eliminate this loophole by making companies regardless of whether or not its data have been processed overseas, required to show that data when asked in a court case.
