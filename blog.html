<h2>16/04/18</h2>
<p>  today we got started in our group project. We got into our groups and after this started setting up our GitHub repository. For Josh and I who have never used Github before , it will be a steep learning curve to learn to properly learn its ins and outs. We then decided on our overall topic for the website. We decided on  data privacy in the present day and how much privacy we actually have on the internet.  That bran us to the end of the session</p>
<h2>18/04/18</h2>
<p>In today's session we started to look at the way were going to tackle our issue. We figured the best way to do this was by investigating current issues in today's news related to the data privacy. These 'case studies' will help us later out in the process when we try to formulate our team's point of view.  We decided that Josh will look at the Australian privacy laws as well as the Facebook saga that are currently raging and Jarryd would look into the new European Union Data Privacy laws that are being introduced next month.  Meanwhile Finn started on the basic template for our website as well as making sure that Josh and I knew how to operate Github.</p>
