<h2>16/04/18</h2>
<p>  today we got started in our group project. We got into our groups and after this started setting up our GitHub repository. For Josh and I who have never used Github before , it will be a steep learning curve to learn to properly learn its ins and outs. We then decided on our overall topic for the website. We decided on  data privacy in the present day and how much privacy we actually have on the internet.  That bran us to the end of the session</p>
<h2>18/04/18</h2>
<p>In today's session we started to look at the way were going to tackle our issue. We figured the best way to do this was by investigating current issues in today's news related to the data privacy. These 'case studies' will help us later out in the process when we try to formulate our team's point of view.  We decided that Josh will look at the Australian privacy laws as well as the Facebook saga that are currently raging and Jarryd would look into the new European Union Data Privacy laws that are being introduced next month.  Meanwhile Finn started on the basic template for our website as well as making sure that Josh and I knew how to operate Github.</p>
<h2>20/04/18</h2>
<p>oday Josh and Jarryd continued researching our case studies. Finn continued to work on the website and made all the necessary pages that will be needed.</p>
<h2>23/04/18</h2>
<p> today in class the research continued.  We all worked on what we had being doing the last week.  Jarryd also took a break from his research to start with the Gnatt chart.  With the help from Finn, he was able to setup Gnatt project and get started on adding in different items. This was uploaded to GitHub for revision and change by other members of the group by the end of the class</p>
<h2>27/04/18</h2>
<p>today in class worked continued on the website and the case study. The writes up have both started for Jarryd and Josh, with the aim for the write up to not take too long, so the project can move on. Nothing else really took place during this lesson.</p>
<h2>30/04/18-</h2>
<p> today was very similar to Friday. Worked continued on the website as well as the write up. </p>
<h2>2/05/18</h2>
<p>today we completed two Literatu quizzes. Each quiz was 10 multiple choice questions on things related to what we have been doing in class and on our SAC. After this the project resumed , with Jarryd completing the write up on the European Law Case Study and was able to start embedding that information into the code for the web page.</p>
<h2>4/05/18</h2>
<p> today in class  Jarryd  was able to finish the embedding of information into the webpage. This means that all will be changed now will be the CSS and the look of the page. Finn then helped Jarryd to upload the updated branch to the Github repository  and then merge the branch with the master branch. That about took us to the end of the session. </p>
<h2>7/05/18</h2>
<p>Today Josh worked on the write up for the Facebook Case Study. There is a lot of information to filter through, so it taking Josh a little bit of time. It shouldn’t be longed until he will be able start embedding the information into the webpage.  Jarryd and Finn continued to work on the website in making it better and improved.</p>
<h2>9/05/18</h2>
<p>Today during class work continued on the website. Josh is getting very close to finishing the write up for the Facebook Case study and will then move onto the Australian Privacy Act Case study. Jaryd and Finn started on the dropdown menu for each of the page. It's going to take a bit of work, but once it is up and running it shouldn’t be too bad</p>
<h2>11/05/18</h2>
<p>Well this was a big lesson. A lot happened.  To start with Finn added the comments page and uploaded an third party commenting server. This will allow viewers to comment their view on the issue. Josh was also able to finish embedding the information on the Facebook Case Study and upload that to the Github repository. The branch was merged with the master branch . Finn then went in and edited the CSS to make sure that everything fitted nicely on the page. Meanwhile Jarryd continued to add the navbar and dropdown menu to all the different pages and with the help of Finn was able to make it work. Finn also edited the CSS to make the navbar look nice and so it would fit with the theme of our website.  That took us to the end of the lesson.  </p>
<h2>14/05/18</h2>
<p>Things are going well. Josh has now started the Australian Data Privacy Case study  and is virtually finished and Jarryd is working on the website. Jarryd messed around with the home page, adding image links to various pages around the website.  This was the session when the start on some of the more administrative work got started. Jarryd started going through everything everyone had completed as well as looking at some of the other required tasks that are needed for this SAC. </p>
<h2>16/05/18</h2>
<p>the session started with Jarryd and Josh messing around with links in the dropdown menu. One of the links wasn't working and after much mucking around finally got it to work.  Jarryd then moved onto the administrative tasks while Josh went on to working on the logo for our website. He was able to design and then upload it to all the different pages. Also around this time, Josh finished the write up and the embedding for the Australian Data Privacy Case Study. All that needs to be done is to upload it to the Github repository, so the css can be added to it.  </p>
<h2>18/05/18</h2>
<p> During this session, Finn was back and decided to fix up the logo. Working with Josh they were able to redesign the logo and then upload it to the website. After they had designed it, Josh went off to upload it to the main website while Finn went and worked on the image link on the index page. He was able to make the text next to image appear when you hover over the image and that took us to the end of the session.</p>
