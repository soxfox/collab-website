    <p> So how much data privacy do we actually have in the 21st century compared to past times? Do we have too much or too little? It is a fact every internet user has to be prepared in order to use various services, applications and website online – as anyone and anything can exploit your details. Even though you can prepare yourself for this, there is still too much publicity as we evolve through the years – rather than the growth of security. Privacy really depends on the applications or software that are used during an online session. Overall, as the years go by, we are getting less and less. In order for us to have a safer online-world in the future, we need stricter data privacy laws to prevent something like the Facebook case from happening again. We believe that we should look at implementing similar laws to that of the European Union. These new laws are needed worldwide, to protect everyone and to make sure there are no grey areas between different countries. We also do believe that the global privacy laws are outdated - considering they were passed back in the 1988 Privacy Act. </p>
